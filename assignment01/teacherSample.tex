\begin{section}{Getting started}
LaTeX requires two things. First, you need the software to turn your code into a readable document - a compiler. See \href{http://miktex.org}{miktex.org} for the appropriate download; you should run the \emph{basic MikTex installer}.

Once this is finished, you need some kind of text editor. Though notepad or TextEdit will do the job, I recommend \href{http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/}{TexStudio} for Windows. If you're on a Mac, I've been told \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeXShop}{TeXShop} is good.

Once you have an compiler and a code editor installed, open the file \emph{sample.tex} in your editor. It's the code that compiles to create this pdf. Just take a look around, comparing it to this pdf. I bet you'll quickly see the correspondence.
\end{section}

\begin{section}{Title of the second section}
Here are two kinds of lists. Use sparingly.
\begin{enumerate}
\item First item.
\item Second item.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent Sometimes you don't want to indent.
\begin{itemize}
\item First item.
\item Second item.
\end{itemize}
Define a function $F\co\Z\to\Q$ by the following formula. \[f(n)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^n \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{2k-1}\] Observe that $\lim_{n\to\infty}f(n)=\pi/4$, while $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}f(n)=\pi/4$.
\begin{subsection}{The title of a subsection}\label{section1}Hello, world!\\ %the two backslashes specify a new paragraph. Another way to linebreak is to skip a line in your source.
Sometimes it makes sense to refer to another work; see, for example \cite{GS}. For a list of commonly used symbols, see \cite{L}. For a more in-depth look at \LaTeX, see \cite{O}.
\end{subsection}
\end{section}

\newpage %skip to a new page.

\begin{section}{Figures}The subfig, hypcap, and graphicx packages that appear at the beginning of the document have to do with including figures that might have subfigures and captions, and subfigures with captions. It will be difficult if you're too picky about precisely where things are situated.

\begin{figure}[h]\capstart
	\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pic}\end{center}
	\caption{Chloe has something important to say.}\label{picture}
\end{figure}

The [h] in the code for Figure~\ref{picture} is optional. It specifies you want the figure to appear ``here" as opposed to the bottom of the page [b], top [t], or on its own special float page [p]. If you write [hb] it means you'd rather it be ``here" in the text, but will settle for the bottom of the page if that's not possible. The default, if left blank, is [htbp]. A few notes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \href{http://inkscape.org}{Inkscape} is a fine, free figure-making program.
\item It is best for your images to be in pdf format. In Inkscape, once you have your figure, press ctrl+shift+d and choose ``fit page to drawing" and save as a pdf into the same folder as your code.
\item The label commands in the figure code allow you to link to them in your pdf. See Figure~\ref{picture} and also look back at Section~\ref{section1}, etc.
\item You'll probably need to look at a forum or two and do some Google searches in order to get things up and running to your liking. My knowledge of figures in \LaTeX \ is limited.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h!]\capstart%
	\centering\capstart
	\subfloat[First subcaption.]{\label{picture1}\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{fold}} \qquad \qquad
	\subfloat[Second subcaption.]{\label{picture2}\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{cusp}}
	\caption{A figure that consists of two subfigures.}
\end{figure}

The references to the other figures look like Figure~\ref{picture1} and Figure~\ref{picture2}. Notice I don't have to number the pictures in the code. The [h!] in the figure tells \LaTeX \ to put the figure ``here" even if the result looks ugly. Sometimes it ignores the ! anyway. Finally, the qquad commands put a little space between the figures.
